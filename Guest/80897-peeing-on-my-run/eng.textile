Hey, so since I am new to this community (not new to the kink) I figured id start off with a few of my most enjoyable ones I've had, this happened pretty recently, think possibly this week or last weekend, regardless, I hope you enjoy.

So I'm fairly athletic, I do a few sports regularly and I also go to the gym and go for runs and cycles, and so I have done things similar to this before, and continue to do them.

It was around 7pm, I had gotten back from work about 45 minutes ago and I was just unwinding and getting ready to go on a run for the evening, I didn't bother changing my panties, as I was gonna sweat a fair bit so there was no point changing into clean ones, at the time I was wearing some white panties, I put on some white ankle length socks, a dark red sports bra, a white t shirt, a black hoodie, some black gym shark leggings, and some black high top converse, grabbed my phone, a water bottle and my airpods and went outside, it was raining very heavily, no matter, and I went to walk towards the cycle path.

At this point I remembered that I hadn't used the toilet since my work break at 3pm, but I didn't need to pee too badly so I didn't worry, I was trying to get my water down me before I started running, as there was a bin at the start and I didn't want to take the bottle with me, after walking about 5 minutes, I got to the path, and finished off my 600ml water and threw the bottle in the bin and went on to do my run, which consisted of 1.5 miles there and 2 miles back on a different path.

All was going pretty well, still had the urge to pee, but I'm not too fussed about having small leaks whilst exercising as I know its fairly normal, I've leaked whilst doing split squats, I know its nothing to worry about, but a fair amount of time later my urge to pee was getting really strong, I'd ran a little bit over a mile at this point, and although I wasn't too fussed about having leaks, it was becoming fairly likely that it may be a bit more than a leak or two.

I got to the 1.5 mile point and was REALLY feeling the urge, for the last 10 minutes id been stopping occasionally to cross my legs and hold my crotch, the rain was still coming down really heavy and id been running through puddles on the way there, and I knew the other path I was taking home was prone to flooding, and I knew that it was gonna become really distracting for me, so I walked over to a bench where I would normally take a quick break, when I had the idea just to let go, after all I had plenty of reasons to, I have a piss kink, I was wearing all black so the moisture wouldn't show up, I was already fairly wet from the rain and the moisture from it wasn't showing up on my leggings and since the weather was a bit gloomy, no one was around to see me doing it.

So when I was sat down, I separated my thighs, put my left hand on my hip, held my phone in my right hand, went to the clock and started the stopwatch and began to let loose, I felt my hot piss shoot out and start to soak into my leggings, my pee began to warm me up a lot which felt super good as I squeezed my thighs together and felt the stream change course and warm and soak other parts of my legs and leggings, I crossed my legs too and it felt really good again, I then decided to stand up and push with full force as it sprayed down my legs and drenched my leggings, my panties were soaked and my pee had started to get my socks wet too as I felt the stream start to dribble down into my converse and get my socks wet.

I then sat back down again and enjoyed the last bit of my stream with my thighs squeezed together, my stream finished and I stopped the stopwatch as it read 2 minutes and 41 seconds, I felt incredible, felt a bit naughty too, my bum and legs felt really nice and warm too, I stood up and carried on with my walk on the 2 mile path, as usual it was flooded, but I carried on, and I started to get another urge to pee, but I didn't care and carried on, as my shoes sloshed through the water as it eventually got deep enough to submerge my legs, about halfway up my calves.

I kept going on until I got back to the start, and I sat down again for another short rest, I needed to pee again, but I decided to hold it a bit longer, after a few minutes I stood up and began to slowly walk back to my house, but I was putting full force on trying to pee (I can often find it a little difficult to pee, its a mentality thing, I can do it fine in a shower, just not in public and fully dressed, after about 14 seconds of trying I managed to get the stream going, and kept pushing to make it stronger, as the stream was a little week.

But it eventually became stronger as I walked home, it felt pretty nice as I felt it rush down my legs, and my bladder was empty after about a minute and I walked home, when I got inside, my dad greeted me and said food was ready, which felt a little weird interacting with him whilst soaking in my own piss, but I followed him through to the kitchen and saw my two brothers also sat down, as I sat down with them to eat, which again felt kinda weird since I had peed myself not even 15 minutes ago.

I finished my food, went upstairs to my room and had another idea, I took my converse off, grabbed a towel and headed to the bathroom to take a shower, I only took my hoodie, t shirt and sports bra off, but kept my socks, panties and leggings on, hopped in the shower, and started to shower with my clothes on, I rubbed my legs and leggings with the flowing hot water, and cleaned them off a bit, same with my socks, I took both of them off, threw them in the sink and then did the same with my panties, although I should admit, when I did my panties, rubbing with the hot water, I got a bit carried away and had a very enjoyable time ; )

I finished cleaning off, had a normal shower, grabbed my towel, wrapped it around myself, grabbed my clothes and headed to my room to dry off, i threw the clothes in a basket, dried off, put some new clothes on to relax in, (light green leggings, same white sports bra, new white ankle socks) and I took my wet clothes down and put them in the dryer, they came out dry, didn't have the clean clothes smell, but didn't smell of sweat or pee either, so I deemed them clean, and I'm currently wearing the same outfit now (except the shoes), theres something about it that makes wearing them feel really good, something about peeing and showering in them and then drying them and wearing them again is a really nice feeling.

Anyway, thats the end, I hope you enjoyed, as I'll be writing two more to sum up my 3 best experiences so far, and then I'll be swapping to talking about experiences as they happen.
