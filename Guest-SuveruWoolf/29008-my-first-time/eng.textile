I was a young boy and had to go really bad... My bladder was so full that i have to explode when I never go to toilet...

Suddenly the phone rang and I was alone at home so I was the only one who can take the call... Under pressure I answer the phone: it was my grandma from 200mi far away place... She talked to me long and told me very uninteressting storries...

After a while during standing at the table and holdin it back my legs started shivvvvvering and my head swettin... With crossed legs i try to hold the call short but the grandma never want to stop ...

... Now i was on that point of no return: should i hang up and run to bathroom or not... My grandma is a person they call not often and we all are see her not so often ... I choose the way of pain and... Fail!!

After a half hour i couldn't take it any more and fall on knees: the doors open and the light golden fluid startet run down... Wettin all: pants... Floor... Tablefeet... It was so embrassing...

Sure: i was alone and my grandmother dont check it that i exactly wettin myself now... But i quick must hang up... And do the laundry... So it startet... But to the next time i play with that it should take 4 years to go into it and love it ;P

What do you think? What have you done in this case?
