Now I just got home from a bus ride home from work and boy was I desperate. My work involves physical labor while wearing jeans and long-sleeved shirts usually. Today at work I had on a white t-shirt, blue jeans, and thick boots. I drank 2 20 oz bottles of soda in an hour and a half or so.

I could have peed before the ride, but I did not feel no urgent need. We passengers waited and waited and waited for the bus. A little bit of a full bladder started to be felt by me when the bus arrived 15 minutes late.

Within a few minutes on the bus, I started having to go really bad. My urge was a 9/10. I had taken a seat in the third row. Throughout the entire 30 minute ride, I squeezed my legs tight tight together and scrunched my toes. My ankles were crossed switching every few seconds.

At long last the bus reached my stop a 10 minute walk from my house. While walking, actually running, I almost squirted into my boxers. Passing house after house not my own was agonzing. Finally I got home.

I opened then closed the garage door, and had to do a few tasks. First I organized the mail, took off my dirty shoes which having to pull hard nearly caused wetting, and threw my dirty clothes in the hamper. Naked I ran to the bathroom a peed a long stream. After being done, I immedietately went to my room and logged on here. I am home alone right now.
