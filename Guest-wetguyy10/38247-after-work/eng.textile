So after work one day I decided not to use the bathroom before I left. this is not really a big deal (I live like 10 min. away). but once I got home I was pretty desperate (I also went grocery shopping afterwards. Anyway, when I was bringing in the last of my groceries I was fumbling around trying to open the door; the need to pee was not helping the situation. and so I leaked a little. and that helped me get inside. now here I am with a wet spot showing on my khakis just about the size of a quarter and I knew my grey briefs were a little wet. At this point I just decided I wanted to hold a little longer. so I start putting all my groceries away and I was leaking as I went about this (moving around was not helping and I really needed to go!) once I got done and heading to the bathroom I could hardly stop myself from leaking. once I was in I just decided to stand in front of the mirror while in the tub and let go( I was already pretty wet anyway

). so I just stood there and watched the hot piss run down my legs and soaking my boxers, pants, and socks!
