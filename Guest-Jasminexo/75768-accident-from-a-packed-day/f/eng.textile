Hey, since this is my first proper post, I thought I’d introduce myself and give a bit more knowledge about me (if you’re not to bothered to read it, skip to the **). My name is Jasmine, I’m 21 and I’m from Wales, I’ve recently made a return to this site after suffering from a UTI which I caused whilst being careless about Omo, but I’m better now and am happy to be back. Also, in terms of appearance, I’m quite tall for a girl at 178cm, my legs are fairly long and have a fair bit of muscle, so my thighs and calves are on the thicker side, and then other than that I’m fairly thin, I have smallish boobs and I’m blonde with green eyes and I wear glasses.

So my day was looking to be a little busy when I woke up that morning, I knew what I had to do but I also knew it wouldn’t take all day. First thing first, I got dressed into a pair of grey leggings, a black sports bra and had a pair of white socks and a pair of white trainers and then headed to my kitchen to get myself a cup of tea, probably about 300ml, and once I finished it, I got one of my shakers out and made some pre workout (essentially just a huge amount of caffeine to help with working out) and it was about 250ml, and then I grabbed my keys and my shaker and headed to the gym in my car, I had drank my pre workout whilst driving so it would kick in when I arrived, and so when I arrived, I bought a bottle of water from the front desk, which was about 600ml and got started on my workout, and I gradually drank my water throughout my workout, and finished both my water and my workout about an hour and 40 minutes after.

I then went home to shower and get changed, didn’t feel an urge to pee since I imagine a lot of what I drank was sweated away or used up in my workout, finished my shower, but I had realised I hadn’t done my laundry for a while and didn’t have anything to wear, so I put the same pair of grey leggings back on, put on a normal bra, t shirt, and hoodie, and then still had my white socks but changed my trainers out for a pair of Nike Airforces, and then went back out to my car to head to town, on my way there I stopped at Costa to grab a Large Vanilla Latte, and then headed to go to my weekly shop, I bought typical stuff, toiletries, drinks, food, that sort of thing, and I was in and out in about half an hour, and as I packed my things into my car I started to get a slight urge to pee, but didn’t really worry about it and wrote it off. I had a good while until I had to go to my next thing, so I decided to head into a larger town nearby to do some shopping.

The drive took my about 20 minutes and I still had a slight urge but was still ignoring it. I had passed by another Costa on my way into the town and decided to pick up another Vanilla Latte, and had finished it by the time I had arrived at the shopping centre. I went around and bought some luxuries, I spent about 15 minutes in a perfume shop picking up a new scent, I spent another few minutes looking at some jewellery and picked up a necklace and some earrings and then went to buy myself a new pair of shoes, which were another pair of airforces, when I started to feel a bit more pressure in my bladder but carried on regardless, and then finally I entered a clothes store and spent some time picking out some new clothes, specifically I bought a few pairs of leggings, jeans, underwear, and some hoodies and socks.

It was a warm day and I had sweated a lot in my leggings from the workout and heat so they felt a bit gross, so I decided to head to the changing room and change into something I’d just bought, I picked out a pair of beige/tan jeans and got changed into them, but didn’t change anything else. I headed out to my car to pack my stuff up when my urge to pee got a fair bit stronger, I was gonna head to the toilet that they had, but it was a fair distance and I figured I might be late to my dentist appointment, so I hopped in my car and drove back near to my home to my dentist, after the 20 minute drive I was feeling a fair bit desperate and definitely could’ve used the toilet, I arrived at the front desk, and I was really hoping that I’d have a minute before he was ready to have me, but no, the dreaded words “you can see him now please” fell out her mouth, so I walked up the stairs to his office for my appointment and sat down in the chair.

The chair made it feel a bit better, as the urge didn’t feel as strong when sat in the chair, but it was still a prominent urge, and it got worse from there, only a few minutes in he had seen my teeth were pretty good, but he still had some stuff to do, and used these water jets to do a bit of cleaning, which made it a lot worse with just the sound of high pressure water, and my hands quickly made their way to my crotch, he then used a scraping tool on the back on my teeth (Input joke about British people having bad teeth) which didn’t help either as the feeling went straight through me, which made holding a bit more difficult...

And then he finished it off with the water jets again and I was done, I thanked him for his time and headed down the stairs quickly to the toilet, only to find it was occupied, I waited a couple of minutes with my legs crossed and my hand in my crotch and I was slightly bent over, but after a few minutes no one had come out, so I just decided to suck it up and go home.

The Walk to my car was absolutely torturous, the car park was a few minutes away and I was really bursting for a pee now, and every minute or so I had to stop briefly with my legs crossed to make sure I didn’t leak, since my underwear was pretty skimpy and wouldn’t absorb anything so it would go straight into my jeans. I managed to get to my car and thought it could be a good idea to pop a squat, I leant against my car and looked around, ready to pull my jeans down and let loose, I was behind my car and between my car and a wall, so it was fairly secluded, and I undid my belt and my button and zipper whilst still looking around and started to slowly pull my jeans down and started to squat down, but when I did, a few cars came into the car park and I quickly stood up and pulled my jeans up, and probably did it a bit too quickly as I had just released a bit of pee into my jeans...

The stain wasn’t super noticeable but it was there, and I decided to put my zipper, button and belt back up and got in my car to head home, whilst driving I had a few red lights which really didn’t help things, and I had another spurt when driving but was able to hold it in, I was now driving with one hand on my crotch and one hand on the steering wheel (I drive a manual or stick shift as some call it) and town driving was definitely a pain, and I had to remove my hand from my crotch a couple times.

I eventually got home though, with a decently sized wet patch on my new jeans, I hopped out my car and locked it when disaster, my neighbour spotted me and started to have a chat with me, I was behind a fence which came up to my stomach area, I tried to make it less obvious I was super desperate, so I wasn’t squirming or anything, but my legs were crossed and my hands buried into my crotch as I attempted to string together a decent conversation, but I couldn’t do both at the same time and lost control of my bladder mid conversation, I didn’t really react to it as I didn’t want to make it obvious, but I managed to kick my shoes off in time as my piss soaked my new beige jeans and I separated my legs a bit and removed my hand from my crotch as it was futile, my piss kept flowing out of my jeans and I briefly looked down to see the whole front was soaked and my piss was still pouring out and soaking my socks.

My bladder emptied and my stream stopped, our conversation was still going and I was just stood there in my soaked beige jeans and white socks, our conversation came to an end about a minute later and she headed inside her home, and I squatted down to pick my shoes up and head to my front door and entered inside, the front and back of my beige jeans were completely soaked, but I decided to stay in them for a little longer, I took my socks off and wrung them out in the sink and chucked them in the laundry basket, but I stayed in my soaked beige jeans for a little while longer, I headed into my living room and sat down on my sofa with a can of Pepsi, and played on my switch and wii for a few hours whilst sat in my soaked jeans, and eventually they actually became quite dry, but I had a slight urge to pee, and so I released and it soaked my bum again and my thighs and dripped onto the floor.

I finished and got up to get a towel and cleaned up my puddle, and then I decided I was done, peeled off my jeans and chucked them in the laundry basket, and then went to my room and took everything else off to have a shower, once I came out I dried off and put my panties back on that I’d peed in, and then put on some comfy leggings and socks and chilled for the rest of my day.

I definitely enjoyed it, but it was a bit worrying for me as I’m not sure how I’d feel about being caught, so I was a bit panicked at the time, but it was fun overall. Hope you enjoyed reading this.
