I hadn’t done anything involving diapers before, but when I heard Endgame was going to be 3 hours, I started making plans. About an hour before my showing, I stopped by the store to get the diapers and some snacks for the film. I couldn’t stop looking behind me while trying to choose. Once I picked, I went through the self- checkout and went to my car.

There, I navigated actually putting the thing on. It was a pull-up style, and I wasn’t entirely sure which side was the front. I was also doing this in the driver’s seat. Eventually, I got situated, got to the theater, and found a seat.

And... nothing happened. Aside from the tiny urge that had been there since I got the diaper on, I didn’t feel much need. I drove home and, not wanting to waste the opportunity, chugged some water and pissed myself. I tried to go slow at first, but I eventually just let loose. It was so warm and nice. I got myself off, still wearing the diaper, then typed this out. Over the time it took to do so, I refilled a bit, so I went ahead and let that out too. There’s a bit of a leak to clean, but otherwise it was great!
