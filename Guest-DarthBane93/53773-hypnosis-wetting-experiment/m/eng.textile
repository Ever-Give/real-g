So I have the house to myself and decided for some omofun tonight. At first I was holding to about 70%, but then I decided I wanted to try something else, a hypnosis wetting. I'm usually pretty skeptical about them working but I figured the fuller bladder would help. It's probably just getting in the relaxed state more than anything, I was surprised it worked without a conscious push my end which never happens! The words helped ground me into the moment, and I really relished feeling that warm wet gold flowing out of me, soaking my butt and sides, and even that hiss! I rarely have the hiss experience because usually my intentional wettings are too slow a flow lol, wish this was every night in my sleep. Hope you guys enjoy! Now for another hold Linking the youtube video because it's too big for me to put here.
