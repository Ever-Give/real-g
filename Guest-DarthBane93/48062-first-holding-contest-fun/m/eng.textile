Hey guys! Had so much fun last night I had to share. Easily the most desperate I've ever been. Ended up having a holding contest with @Camilla

. I agreed to drink double her fluid intake to make it a real challenge. The agreement was neither of us could go till 9 am, so we'd have to pee in bed if we couldn't hold it. I ended up not even be able to sleep once the desperation got up there lol, bladder felt like a rock, and then I just started doing fun torture to myself with leg lifts and ab stuff is so much harder with a full bladder! So yeah I lost haha. Let's be honest losing a hold is still kind of a win for that blissful feel of release as the warmth just explodes down your legs in all the golden glory. Would definitely do it again. Hope you guys enjoy
