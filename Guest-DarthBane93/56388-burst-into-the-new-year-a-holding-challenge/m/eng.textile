A lovely tumbr user challenged me to drink 16 ounces of water every 15 minutes until I burst. I figure I love it on the opposite gender, why not reciprocate the vibes. I can usually hold way too long but man oh man was I desperate, it like all catches up at once it seems! I was ready to go well before New Years, but all the pacing, leg lifting, bouncing and squirming helped me make it.... to my bed anyways. Prob the second most desperate I've ever been. Hope you all enjoy, Happy New Year! Life is what you make it
