Ok well i got home from school and hung at my friends house for a while and i knew i reallyyyyy had to pee (like always since i dont pee at school ever) but my bladder doesnt yell at me till right when i walk in my house so it was easy holding it. butttt when my friend said i had to leave that ment i would have to climb a fence to my house....and well still not aware i really couldnt hold my pee that well i grabbed me book bag that weighed at lest....35lb no kidding i dont use my locker like an idoit.

Walking out her house I got up to the fence and grabbing it I swung one leg over the fence and consentrating on pulling my self up and not falling cause of my over weight book bag ...but my bookbag was wayyy to much pressure on my poor full bladder and one leg still over on the other side of the fence I started full on wetting my sweat pants without warning!!!! I almost fell out of suprise but gripped the fence then one hand to stop the flow. I could feel my bottom was all wet now and so was the front an the fence dripped pee. I relized I should take my book bag off it was to hard to carry with a full bladder so quickly let go throwing it to the other side the whole time uncontrolable leaking a lot of pee out then jumped in my back yard and grabbing my bookbag ran back to my house. I stopped peeing but on my back pourch stopped seeing no one was around I just stood in front of the door and finshed wetting my self and it felt gooood ^_^
