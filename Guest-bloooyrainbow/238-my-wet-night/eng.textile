A few days ago my life has been a little down... so what better to make you happy then wet your self? =] I drank half a liter of coke around 4pm and didnt go alllll day! My mom kinda noticed me being all twichy and nervous and kept asking if i was sick or somthing...and that was a perfect timing she said that cause I didnt know just how longer i could wait. I told her I felt sick and was going to bed early ( if i went to bed early without saying I was sick she would of been suspisious) I quickly ran upstairs and layed in my bed/mat thingy lol and waited.

I really had to go and already started dripping pee on to my panties but I wanted to wait a little longer just in case my mom came to check on me. 10 mins later I could feel I was sitting in a small puddle cause of a few uncontroled spurts and I didnt cae anymore. I got up and sneaked to my old room clutching my crotch bouncing thinking where to go let it allll out. I got about to steps in my room but a hard feeling hit me and I quickly spreaded my legs apart watch my crotch of my sweat pants damping and like a faucet drop to the floor making that wounderful sound of first pattering on the carpet then started splashing sinking in the carpet. About half way I dropped to the floor to sit in my puddle and finsh up!.....a great way to relief stress from a crappy week
