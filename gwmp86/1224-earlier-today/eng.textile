Okay, so last night I stayed at my friend Tyler's house and stayed up late into the night drinking cans of sprite. By the time I fell asleep I didn't really need to pee but when I woke up, it was a pretty strong sensation of urine pressing on my bladder, but I didn't have time to go cuz he was late for school and hadta drive me home. By the time I got home, I knew I wasn't gonna be able to get up the stairs in my house in the condition I was in. So I waddled my way, yes waddled because at this point I was holding my crotch, to the trailer I live in on the sideyard of my house.

As soon as I got inside, I went straight for my stash of Depends. I rushed to pull off my pants while holding my pee as much as I could. As soon as the diaper was snug on me, I let go. pee flowed out of me causing a loud hissing sounds as the warm liquid spread throughout the diaper. It felt SOOOOOOO good and relieving. When I finally changed out of the diaper, I saw that it was completely soaked from front to back with pee, I had almost flooded it. But that's how my morning started. Quite a nice start to the day.

Yeah haha, it was a massive relief when I finally let go, and it felt even better because it was all warm and stuff. Needless to say I enjoyed it hahaha.
