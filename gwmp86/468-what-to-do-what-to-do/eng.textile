I have been drinking Kool-Aid all day.....about 3 quarts of it, little less than that....and now I'm squirming in my seat. Should I hold it in? Or go use the bathroom? ;) I'll let all of you decide.

Well, a few seconds after posting this, I tookk another swig of Kool-Aid and before I could even swallow it, I felt a warm squirt of urine dampen my boxers. Holding it as much as I could, I jolted to the bathroom, leaking a little more every step. By thhis time, I just didn't want to make a mess on the floor so I jump into the tub. The moment I get in there, the floodgates of my bladder burst and I feel a gush of pee soak my pjs, run down my leg, and burst between my fingers that were cupped over my crotch in a futile effort to stop peeing.

I find myself standing there for what feels like forever, just listening to the liquid hiss out of me, soak my pants, and slosh around in the tub as wet spot on my pjs widens and widens til it takes up all of my crotch area, most of my right leg, and part of my left leg. After I felt I was done peeing, I take a shower and have to pee again! I just let it out since I'm in the shower anyways. I get out and take care of the dirty laundry and here I am now.

Not a problem with sharing it :) (mainly cuz I know people on this site would rather it be shared hehe). I'll be sure to share other "accidents" as well. ;)
