For whatever I am remembering a lot of actual wetting accidents I have had. There’s more than I remembered prior. This particular one I was out in my neighborhood walking around at night. My reason for being out was just to unwind and to grab some beer too. I remember grabbing 2 cheap rock gut tall boys that were 8%. Disgusting cheap beer, steel reserve. I didn’t need flavor that night just booze. I stopped in some remote spots and drank under the moon and stars, beautiful night. Ran into some friends and chatted about the old times. 

I finished the 2 cans and started walking home. It was about midway there and my bladder began to hurt real bad, it was within that slightly intoxicated state that I then realized I had to go and trying to hold while walking intoxicated is not easy. I started to dribble some before I just found a good spot and sat down finally giving in. The warmth went everywhere. The only tragedy was my favorite pink panties but that’s what we have good laundry soap for lol. That was not a bad night at all. It was very relaxing.
