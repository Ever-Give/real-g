Strange feelings when getting high...

Hey guys, this is something that I've found has been happening when I smoke a particular strain of weed c.

So given that I'm at the end of my university degree here and everything's moved online (including exams) I genuinely have fuck all to do but study, play video games and occasionally treat myself to a nice smoke to help me sleep.

Recently I bought 1/8th of a strain called Amnesia Haze. It's a nice one that get's me quite energetic and talkative by comparison to other types. But there's one distinct feeling I get when smoking it.

I very often get the feeling that my crotch and bag of my legs are kinda numb and warm, and sometimes they feel almost wet. I've found myself having to check that I've not had an accident (for the record, I've never had an accident while intoxicated) and it's kinda worrying. Luckily it's never materialised but the fear is there whenever I smoke.

I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced the same with this strain (or other strains for that matter)? And if there's anyone who knows what causes the feeling?
