Wetting yourself in the chair at the hair stylist?

Hopeful's story reminded me of a couple of incidents that I had in the chair while I was having my hair cut as a kid...

I think there's just something about being sat there, with a stranger having all their attention focussed on you, that makes it so hard to deal subtly with any urgent needs.

One time when I was 8, I got so desperate while I was having my hair cut (but was way too shy to admit my predicament to the lady cutting it), and eventually she had to stop and tell my mom that I was squirming around too much for her to finish. Obviously I was absolutely mortified when I got marched out by my mom to go find a toilet as quickly as possible, and then had to come back afterwards to have my hair finished.

Another time when I was 10, I did a better job of hiding my desperation, but unfortunately my bladder let me down. The whole thing was very quickly discovered when the pee started dripping from the seat into a puddle on the floor.

Did anyone else have any times like this?
