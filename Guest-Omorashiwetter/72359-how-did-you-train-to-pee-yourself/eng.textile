Hi, i have some problems to pee myself in some positions and places. I didn't have problems in the shower or in the swimming pool. But i do when i'am laying in my bed or when i'am sitting on a chair. I have problems to start pee and when i start i can't finish my bladder in one time. Any help? Sometimes i feel so lazy that i wanted to wet myself in my bed because i habe a rubber bed sheet and the sticky warm smelly peejama's are adorable but still have some problems to doing it
