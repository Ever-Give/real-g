SCHOOL FIELD TRIP DESPERATION

This is a true story from when I was in school as a kid - I've told it before on other omorashi/desperation forums, so some of you might find it familiar

When I was in school, one day our class took a field trip. We went from our school in the far southeast corner of Queens into Manhattan, to the Town Hall Theater, to see a performance of African folk dances. It was actually a great show, but I suspect some of my female classmates couldn't appreciate it.

If you've ever been to the Town Hall Theater, you'll note that they have the bathrooms arranged very oddly

It's an old theater, and I suspect when it was built they didn't have any ladies rooms at all - just a men's room in the basement for the orchestra level male theatergoers, and another men's room in the balcony for men up there....and no toilets for women at all (this was common in theaters in NYC up until the 1920s - only men got restrooms, and women were expected to sit through the entire performance without anywhere to pee)

At some point the theater was retrofitted - the men's' room in the basement remained a men's room, and the balcony men's room got converted to a ladies room

We had all gotten to school at the usual time - 8:40 - our teacher Mrs G didn't let us use the bathroom before leaving, and the three mothers who had volunteered to chaperone the trip (my mom was one of them) didn't insist that we get to go, so when we got to the theater at 10 we all had to pee.

We got to the theater, and Mrs G, my mom and the other two moms saw that the only bathroom directly accessible from the lobby was the men's room in the basement. The arrangement the theater had with the school was that the kids were allowed in the orchestra seating, but not the balcony, for safety reasons.

So...they told the girls to wait in the lobby while the boys got to go pee in the men's room

The girls had to pee just as bad as we did, so they were very upset - they clearly saw the big sign that said LADIES ROOM that pointed up to the balcony, they were all as anxious to pee as we were, so they stated pleading "Mrs G___, can we PLEASE go to the balcony?" They didn't want to blurt out in front of the boys that they had to pee, and that their only reason for wanting to go to the balcony was to USE THE LADIES ROOM

Mrs G said "NO! students aren't allowed in the balcony!"

So the desperate girls were stuck in the lobby, needing to pee but with no way to go to the toilet and they had to wait while the boys all go to pee

Mrs G, my mom and the other two moms didn't get to pee either, for what it's worth

After we'd finished using the men's room, it was empty, and Mrs G and the moms could have let the girls use the men's room...but apparently that was out of the question

Mrs G made a vague promise to the girls that she'd find some way for them to go to the restroom after the show, then we were led into the theater, and my girl classmates had to sit through a TWO HOUR performance, with full bladders, all badly needing to pee.

The boys paid rapt attention to the African dancers, especially the very charismatic lead male dancer - we really got into the show

The girls....were all very distracted and could not pay attention, for obvious reasons

My mom and the other two moms were also kind of distracted

After the show, the girls were still pleading to "go to the balcony"...the answer was still NO and they were marched out of the theater

Fortunately, Mrs G had planned to take us to a nearby McDonalds for lunch - and that McDonald's had a men's room and a ladies room on the first floor.

We got there, and most of the boys just calmly sauntered over to the counter to order their food (we'd all been told to bring lunch money with us) - we were all thirsty so we all got big sodas.

The girls, on the other hand, immediately made a beeline for THE LADIES ROOM - they were far more interested in that than they were in a Big Mac and a Coke (the last thing any of them needed was any fluid!)

The moms and Mrs G didn't use the facilities - they were just trying to keep track of the boys getting food and the girls squirming in line for the ladies room.

Me and a couple of other boys decided to visit the men's room before ordering our food (in my case because I was very interested in the desperation of my girl classmates) - the men's room was small - I think just one toilet and one urinal - so even with just 3 or 4 boys in there it was overcrowded. I had no idea how small the ladies room was, but there were about 15 girls waiting to use it, so it was overcrowded and there was a long wait

The line was so long that by the time I'd peed, washed my hands, ordered my burger, fries and coke and sat down to eat, there were still girls waiting to use the ladies room.,

Remember, every boy had had a chance to pee when we got to the theater at 10 and if we wanted we got another chance to pee when we got to the McDonald's around 12:30 or so. The girls hadn't had a chance to pee since they left their houses that morning - so most of them hadn't had an opportunity to relieve themselves since at least 8AM

FINALLY all the girls got to pee, and they got to get their food - although they didn't have as much time to eat as we did - all of the boys had sodas with our lunch, I think a whole lot of the girls decided to pass on having a drink with their food

After lunch, Mrs G made sure any boy who needed to got another chance to go to the bathroom - she didn't go, she didn't give the girls or the moms a chance to go either (none of the moms had had a chance to go since they left their houses that morning - including my mom, who I'm pretty sure hadn't had a chance to pee since at least 7 that morning)

We got back on the bus at 1:30, got back to our school at 2:30 - nobody was given a chance to go in the school to use the restroom again, we all just got sent home

My mom waited for me so we could go home together - and of course as soon as she got home she immediately rushed to the bathroom
