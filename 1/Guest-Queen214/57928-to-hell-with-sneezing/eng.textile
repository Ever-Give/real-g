Today i went to the mall with a guy friend. He just came with me cuzzz i wanted some company and cuzzz i didn't wanna be walkin around the mall with no one to talk to.

I know ya'll like knowin details on what people be wearin and what not so ill tell you... I had on Black Slim Adidas striped track pants, a pair of plain cotton bikini panties a white bra and a white short tank top showing off my navel piercing ... i got my mamas hips n booty so i was lookin quite good...

Anyways while him and i were walkin around i had a bit of an urge to go pee... i didn't think about it to much... i kinda just quickly gauged in my head how long it might be before its an issue... i estimated 30mins... now while some of ya'll probably think that's super soon! i understand lol... i tend to frequently use the bathroom... high volume low quality if you wanna think of it that way lmao...

So we were in the cloths section and he was off checkin out some shoes and i was looking at some cute socks i might wanna get when suddenly in a split second i felt that inner feeling when your about to sneeze... and i was like oh crap! cuzzz to be honest i kinda tinkle whenever i sneeze, urgent or not i still pee a lil... so i quickly just put my legs real close, essentially just crossed them and held onto my self down there with a hand while the other covered my mouth and i sneezed... "ah choo" not a heavy duty loud one just a lil one...

But it didn't matter... i felt myself start go pee! my heart started to race and i honestly in real life started sayin, "oh no, oh no" quietly to myself... i felt my panties become wetter and wetter... but i was fortunate enough to be able to stop myself from completely just peeing in the middle of the fricken isle... i felt a little stream run down my leg and i scurried to the bathroom holding myself...

I went in the bathroom and luckily no one was in there... i opened the stall door and shut it behind me... quickly pulled my pants and panties down and sat down and finished my tinkle... while i went i looked down at my panties and they were so wet... i felt so embarrassed..... i finished up peeing and cleaned myself up and i got a few squares of toilet paper and wiped my panties as best as i could... and then i stood up and realized... i gotta pull them back up... so i dreadfully pulled up my very damp panties back up on myself and the same with my pants... i flushed and left the stall and looked in the mirror... my pants were perfectly dry THANK GOD! but i couldn't help but feel so embarrassed... i washed my hands and checked myself out in the mirror to make extra sure it wasn't obvious that i just peed myself basically...

I walked out of the bathroom feeling the damp cotton fabric against my and felt it a little bit on my ass... i saw my friend still checkin out shoes... hes obsessed... and went up to him and said that im headin home... he said alright and we left... he was completely oblivious as to what had just happened and im so thankful for shoes because of it...

The ride home was quite silent from my part, i just let him ramble on about stuff... i just looked out the window and tried to hide my face... not gonna lie, when he dropped me off and i got up outta the car i quickly just put my hand on the seat to make sure it wasn't wet which it wasn't... but i had to make sure...
