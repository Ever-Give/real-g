Hello, fellow friends of the sun, or... whatever 😆

After lurking around and reading for nearly 4 years, and some encouragement from another person of the community, I've finally decided to post a wetting experience of my own!

After a quite long day out today, with limited access to a toilet, I finally got to go home. I've already had to go for nearly 4 hours, but got really desperate once I got into my car to drive home. I started leaking around the time I got to the door and went up the stairs to my apartment, but decided to have some fun instead of just going to the toilet .

&&

I got myself something to drink and waited, until I just really couldn't anymore.

It actually didn't take to long, just about 20 minutes after getting home, until I had barely enough time to jump into the shower. I completely soaked my jeans in less than 40 seconds 😧.

I wish I had filmed the wetting itself, but my hands were a bit... occupied with holding 😅

What followed was easily one of the biggest wetting I had so far, the wet patch reaching down and almost completely around my legs!

Maybe I'll come around to post some more of my wettings later on, we'll see...

Please don't mind any weird grammar or spelling, English is not my native language 😅😅😅. Have a nice evening/day/night/whatever, y'all!!

Welcome to omorashi it is great to meet you . I enjoyed your story and the pix are a big plus . I love a sequence of pix showing your pants getting wetter. Is your fly truly a button up like it appears? That makes it tough if you hold your pee to the last minute and have to try and unbutton it while desperately trying not to wet your pants.

I hope you post more of your stories. Your English is fine.

Yeah, the fly really is a button up with 4 buttons. Unbuttoning takes a while, true, but I'll take that over a stuck zipper any time 😂😂

I'm glad you enjoyed the story 😁
