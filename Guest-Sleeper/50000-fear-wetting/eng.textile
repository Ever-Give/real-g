Has anyone ever wet themselves with fear? For starters i am almost completely incontinent so i am diapered 24/7 so with that out of the way. It was somewhere around 1-2 AM and i was going to get a drink of water and i heard a noise form outside a small crashing noise so i though my cat was locked outside again and i went outside and tried to pick up what i though was my cat... it was a raccoon when i picked it up it bit me on the hand and i so afraid i started wetting the diaper already wet because bed wetting starts leaking onto the ground (because i was only wearing a diaper and a old t shirt) i still holding on the raccoon threw it down and raced back inside but the damage had already been done after calming down a bit i grabbed a glass of water ,changed my leaking diaper and went back to bed
