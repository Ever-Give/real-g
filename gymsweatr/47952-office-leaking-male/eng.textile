I currently work in an office with only 3 other people. Each of us have our own office and privacy. Two of my office mates leave early, and the one that doesn't travels fairly often. So, I get the office to myself on a regular basis after 2:30 pm. On those days, I like to drink a couple of cups of coffee as well as water, and see how long I can hold it. I try and put myself in a desperate situation before my coworker leaves. 

Once it becomes too much of a distraction, I start letting go small spurts in my pants. Most times, I eventually head to the toilet and let the rest go, then make my way home with somewhat damp pants. I have a 30 minute commute that sometime stretches to an hour if the traffic is bad. My pants are still damp when I get home but nothing noticeable. That is most days, sometimes I over do it and have quite the wet patch. These pics are of one of those days. On this particular day I didn't even have my gym bag with me to change, so home with a wet butt I went. I took the pics at the office before heading out to the elevator to the garage.
